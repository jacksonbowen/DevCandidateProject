# DevCandidateProject

Development Project
Software Engineering Candidate

Description:
This project was designed to assess the aptitude of the “Software Engineer” applicant. This project was not designed to be difficult, but rather give a sense of the coding style and approach the candidate takes in working through this exercise. 

Note: You can use the programming language of your choice. Preferred (C#, Python, JavaScript, Java)

Project:
Classes have finished for the school year and the school district administration is curious to see the results of the 5th grade class from each school. The teachers have already taken the liberty of providing a flat file containing the names and grades of each student. While this would be relatively easy to solve, the administration is asking for an automated way of providing any number of files and receiving the desired results in an output file.

Note: Three files containing grades for classes have been given for use in this project. Please use these files when generating your output file.

Business Requirements:

1.	The output file should be a text file.
2.	Overall scores of 0 should be ignored during the calculation.
3.	Any scores with a decimal should be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
4.	The file should contain the following:
a.	The highest performing class (output in a prominent way)
b.	The averages of all classes.
c.	For eac	h class:
i.	Total number of students within the class
ii.	The number of students used to calculate the class average
iii.	The names of any students who were discarded from consideration
5.	Feel free to add any other information you may find to be useful.


Submission Requirements:
Please submit a zip file containing the generated output file and all created class/module files written to complete this project.

You can simply reply all to the email thread which contained the Development Project info and attach the zip file.
